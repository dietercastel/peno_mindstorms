'test' source folder should contain Junit test classes for the classes in the corresponding package of the 'src' source folder.

Convention proposal: Test*classname*.java
e.g.

In the main program:
src\simulator\Robot.java
has as corresponding test class
test\simulator\TestRobot.java (a Junit 4 testcase)

Using this file structure you can use protected/package fields that will be only used in testing.
e.g.
protected LinkedBlockingQueue<ActionPacket> queue 
(in src\simulator\Robot.java) for use in test\simulator\TestRobot.java


I strongly recommend writing a lot of tests. Certainly for future use.
If you test the basics thoroughly then you are sure they are implemented correctly and you can rely on them.
